To-do (for now)

In order of importance...
	Short term goals:
		1: Finish pokedex.db! It should include *at least* the original 151 + MissingNo., but I want to shoot for the first 386. (Kanto + Johto + Hoenn)
			1a: Use dex information from Pokemon Emerald Version.
			
			DB status: 28/387
		
		2: Include Pokedex blurbs in printouts.
			(DONE!)
		
		3: Rewrite the ReadIntStat function so that it can tell what stat to write to based on the contents of the Junk buffer.
			3a: Once this is done, rename the Junk buffer.
		
		4: Move the file-scanning funtions to processing.c.
		
	Long term goals:
		1: Instead of printing out info for literally every Pokemon in the dex, it should get the name or dex number of a pokemon from a command line argument.
			Example:
				$ pokedex bulbasaur
				Pokemon name:   Bulbasaur 
				Pokedex ID:     1 
				Types:          Grass, Poison 
				HP:             45
				Attack:         49
				Defense:        49
				Sp. Attack:     65
				Sp. Defense:    65
				Speed:          45
				BULBASAUR can be seen napping in bright 
				sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By 
				soaking up the sunâ€™s rays, the seed grows 
				progressively larger.

				$
				
				$ pokedex 004
				Pokemon name: 	Charmander 
				Pokedex ID: 	4 
				Type:           Fire 
				HP:             39
				Attack:         52
				Defense:        43
				Sp. Attack:     60
				Sp. Defense:    50
				Speed:          43
				The flame that burns at the tip of its tail 
				is an indication of its emotions. The flame 
				wavers when CHARMANDER is happy, and blazes 
				when it is enraged.
				
				$
				
			(Almost there!)
		
		2: Contain all of the functionality of the re-designed dex from ShockSlayer's Crystal Clear mod (show base stats, evolutions, locations, et cetera)
		
		3: Make makefile and installer script
			(Makefile has been made!)
		
		4: Make manpage
