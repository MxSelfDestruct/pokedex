To-do (for now)

In order of importance...
	Short term goals:
		1: Finish pokedex.db! It should include *at least* the original 151 + MissingNo., but I want to shoot for the first 386. (Kanto + Johto + Hoenn)
			1a: Use dex information from Pokemon Emerald Version.
		
		2: Include Pokedex blurbs in printouts.
		
		3: Rewrite the ReadIntStat function so that it can tell what stat to write to bas.ed on the contents of the Junk buffer.
			3a: Once this is done, rename the Junk buffer.
		
		4: Move the file-scanning funtions to processing.c.
		
	Long term goals:
		1: Instead of printing out info for literally every Pokemon in the dex, it should get the name or dex number of a pokemon from a command line argument
			Example:
				$ pokedex bulbasaur
				Pokemon name: 	Bulbasaur 
				Pokedex ID: 	1 
				Types: 			Grass, Poison 
				HP: 			45
				Attack: 		49
				Defense: 		49
				Sp. Attack: 	65
				Sp. Defense: 	65
				Speed: 			45
				$
				
				$ pokedex 004
				Pokemon name: 	Charmander 
				Pokedex ID: 	4 
				Type: 			Fire 
				HP: 			39
				Attack: 		52
				Defense: 		43
				Sp. Attack: 	60
				Sp. Defense: 	50
				Speed: 			43
				$
		
		2: Contain all of the functionality of the re-designed dex from ShockSlayer's Crystal Clear mod (show base stats, evolutions, locations, et cetera)
		
		3: Make installer script
		
		4: Make manpage
